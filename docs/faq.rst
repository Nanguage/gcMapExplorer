How to solve - When multiple maps are loaded, tick-labels are overlapped?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several default settings could be change to resolve this issue.

* By changing page size and orientation: When page size is increased, the space
  between maps also increases. Page size can be changed to either standard A4,
  A3 A2 and A1 size or any custom size through menu bar.
* By changing axis properties: Properties such as font-size of axis-labels,
  tick intervals, labels rotation etc can be changed to increase the visibility
  of labels. Axis properties dialog can be accessed by right clicking on any
  map or plot. This dialog contains all necessary options to change the display
  style of axis elements.

By combining these options, display quality of axis-labels can be changed in
case of multiple maps.
