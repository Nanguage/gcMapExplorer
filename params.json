  "body": "# Genome Contact Map Explorer - gcMapExplorer\r\n\r\nIt is a platform to visualize and analyze the contact maps that are generated from Hi-C experiments. This package is developed by considering the huge size of contact maps at very fine resolution. It contains\r\n  * Graphical User Interface - Several windows like applications to perform tasks.\r\n  * Command Line Interface - Several commands to perform tasks.\r\n  * Application Programming Interface - It can be used to perform analysis by any mathematical operations through programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n  * Support for **huge contact maps** - Use of Disk instead of RAM\r\n    * Matrices/arrays are stored in Disks - mathematical operations by directly reading/writing from/to Disks, **without loading them into RAM**\r\n  * A browser with rich interfaces for **Comparative** and **Interactive** visualization of **two dimensional contact maps** with **one dimensional genomic datasets** such as DNase-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq etc.\r\n  * Contact maps can be **zoomed in/out** from finest resolution to whole chromosome level. \r\n  * Rich customizations of **color scale for contact maps** visualization\r\n  * Rich customizations of **X- and Y- axis properties**.\r\n  * Publication ready images at one click.\r\n  * Normalization of contact maps by \r\n    * **Iterative Correction** (IC)\r\n    * **Knight-Ruiz Matrix Balancing** (KR)\r\n    * **Distance-Frequency**\r\n  * A **new file format** for contact map  and genomic datasets:\r\n    * **Portable**, **platform independent** and can be read through C/C++, JAVA, Python and R programming language.\r\n    * **Very fast to read** - fast browsing of contact maps and genomic datasets\r\n  * Another file format for chormosomal contact map - much faster than above format to read/write but not compact\r\n  * Easy import of Coordinate Sparse, HOMER Interaction matrix and Bin-Contact formats to the new formats.\r\n\r\n# Coming soon !!!\r\n  \r\n",
